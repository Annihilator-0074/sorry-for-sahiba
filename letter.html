    <h1>Sahiba 🤍</h1>

    <p>
      I know I hurt you, and I regret it deeply.<br>
      Sleeping without telling you was careless,
      and I take full responsibility for it.
    </p>

    <p>
      You matter to me more than I can explain.<br>
      Every moment without you feels incomplete,
      and all I want right now is to hug you
      and see you smile again.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m learning, I’m trying,
      and I promise to do better — for you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Always yours,<br>
      💗
